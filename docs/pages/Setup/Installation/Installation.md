# Installation

### System Requirements

1. Install the latest version of [Node.js v16.13.2+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. Install [PostgreSQL v10.14+](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). Detailed [install instructions](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/) for all platforms.
1. Install [PostGIS 2.5+](https://postgis.net/install/). From the above install, you can use the 'Application Stack Builder' to install PostGIS or the default [PostGIS install instructions](https://postgis.net/install/) for all platforms.
1. Make a new PostgreSQL database and remember the user, password and database name.
   Use 'pgsl' or the 'SQL Shell' to log into Postgres. It will prompt you for the username and password made during the install.

   Issue the following commands:  
    `CREATE DATABASE mmgis;`  
    `\c mmgis`  
    `CREATE EXTENSION postgis;`  
    `exit`  
   In the above `\c` attaches to the database and `CREATE EXTENSION` enables PostGIS by creating a spatial reference table within that database.

1. GDAL and Python are weaker dependencies (without them not everything will work)

   - GDAL [2.+](https://gdal.org/download.html) with Python bindings
   - Python [2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/)/[3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396/)

### Setup

`/` will always refer to the repo's root directory

1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/MMGIS`

1. From within `/`  
   `npm install`

1. Copy `/sample.env` to `.env`  
   `cp sample.env .env`

1. Open `.env` and update the following:

   ```
   DB_NAME=<name>
   DB_USER=<user>
   DB_PASS=<password>
   ```

   From the install example:

   ```
   DB_NAME=mmgis
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASS=<password>
   ```

1. Run `npm run build` to bundle up the code (first time or if there are any changes)

1. Run `npm run start:prod`

1. Setup the admin account:

   - In your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8888/configure`
   - Sign up for an Administrator account (The Administrator account is always the first user in the database and you are only prompted to create an Administrator account if there are no other users)

1. Now sign in with you Administrator credentials

1. Click `NEW MISSION`  
   Enter a new mission name and click `MAKE MISSION`  
   (Use the mission name `"Test"` (case-sensitive) to make the sample mission)

Go to `http://localhost:8888` to see the `Test` mission

_Note:_ The development environment (`npm start`) and only the development environment uses two port numbers `8888` and `8889` (by default) â€” the latter for the main site and the former for the ancillary pages (such as `/configure` and `/docs`)

---

## Scripts

### Production

1. Run `npm run build` to bundle up the code (first time or if there are any changes)

1. Run `npm run start:prod`

### Development

1. Run `npm start`

### Test

1. Run `npm run test`  
   _Note:_ Jest has just been added in v2.0.0 and test suites are still very limited

## Installing with Docker

To build the Docker image, run:
`docker build -t <image tag> .`

To run MMGIS in a container, you need to create a directory on the host machine and map this to a directory in the container. On the host machine, create a `Missions` directory and copy the contents of `./Missions` to your directory. Map this directory to `/usr/src/app/Missions` in the container. For example, if the host directory is `/Missions`, launch the container with:

`docker run -v /Missions:/usr/src/app/Missions <image tag>`

This repo contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines a service for the application and a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS installed. Simply set all the env variables in `.env` and run:

`docker-compose up`
