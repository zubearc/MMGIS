# Tools Tab

This tab allows you to toggle and customize tools:

- Each tool has a checkbox to toggle it on and off, a description and way to change icons.
  - Icons are currently from Material Design Icons and can be found [here](https://materialdesignicons.com/).
- Some tools have a json text editor underneath them. This signifies that this tool needs more information to work and makes the tool itself configurable. Clicking on the tool's description will bring up an example json with an explanation. For more information, visit the Tool's documentation page.
