# Overall Tab

This tab shows a history of the mission's configuration. From here you can:

- SET a previous configuration to be the current configuration
- Download a configuration as a .json
- Clone the mission to duplicate it
- Upload a custom config.json
- Delete the mission (which will not delete its missions folder data)
